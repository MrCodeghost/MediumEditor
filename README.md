# MediumEditor #

The article editor in the [Medium](http://medium.com) iOS app is great. It provides the user with elegant and very simple formatting controls that allow you to create well formatted articles, without overly complicating the mobile interface.

MediumEditor is an attempt to replicate that interface control for those with similar needs.
